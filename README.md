## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was a simple and direct project, what I can highlight is that performing this type of exercises continuously really helps to develop muscle memory in relation to solving design problems.
These vignettes could well be found as part of a larger project and be able to develop a solution that meets the design requirements it's and important skill.

### Continued development

I think that in the color of the button text there must be a way to be able to take the background color of the card and apply it directly to the text. I will investigate that.
